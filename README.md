# credentialagent-docker-compose
Credential Agent Docker Compose

This agent can be deployed on a single instance as a docker compose that will run the agent and an instance of mongo.
It is **not recommended** to use docker-compose in a production environment.

This has been tested on Version 19 of docker and 1.26 of docker-compose. Your mileage may vary on other versions.

## Docker Prerequisites
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
1. Specify what the token can do (add at least read:packages)
1. Save the token into your working dir in a file named vnf-github-package.token.
1. cat ./vnf-github-package.token | docker login https://docker.pkg.github.com -u USERNAME --password-stdin where USERNAME is the github username.

## Getting Started

Use the credentialagent-docker-compose repo 
1. `git clone https://github.com/velocitynetworkfoundation/credentialagent-docker-compose.git`
1. `cd credentialagent-docker-compose`
1. `cp .env_example .env`
1. Update the .env file if necessary (e.g. generating new `SECRET` or pointing at a different `VENDOR_URL`)
1. `docker-compose pull`
1. `docker-compose up`
1. `curl http://localhost:8080` should return a successful response


#### Agent Env Configuration

The agent runs on HTTPS or HTTP. If you would like to use TLS (recommended) to connect to the agent either:

- use the SERVER_CERTIFICATE_\* to have the agent run TLS termination directly
- run a reverse proxy for TLS termination (nginx is much more efficient than your typical application server)
